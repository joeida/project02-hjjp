The Client is going to be an international businessman. 

The client has to make deals all around the world, sometimes and countries that are not as stable. 
As the client, I want to build and app that's going to let me know if the city/country I'm going to
is going to be safe and what places and plans I can do to make myself prepared for an emergency, 
including fire, theft, terrorism, earthquakes, etc.

So, if I list a series of travel destinations, I should have the ability to determine threat level, 
what threats there would be, how I could best prepare for those threats/danger/etc.


Threats level can be assessed by gathering recent newspaper or research articles and performing a 
text analysis that looks for certain "danger" keywords such as "earthquake", "terrorism" ,etc. 
This can also be coupled with the history of danger in the city or region.


From there, I can determine if I should travel to the country or city or not.
This assessment is qualitative and subjective

The interface should be simple, yet informative. 

I should be able to see the destinations I have chosen and use the threat level to determine
my best course of action. Of course, we can expand on this as well

You can even monetize on it by suggesting equipment to purchase (affiliate marketing)
Or partner with companies or individuals for use as "safe houses".
